## Pure CSS/HTML Div

Wordpress without plugins can be an exhuasting effort.  After being assigned a project with limited plugins, I had to search for a solution using pure CSS & HTML.

I have found that <summary> and <detail> tags are easiest for this exact purpose. o css is required at all as the collapsing and showing are part of the tags definition/formatting.

Example:

<details>
  <summary>This is the Collapsible Heading</summary>
  Content goes here.
</details>

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/auz3ge8e/1/embed/"></script>
